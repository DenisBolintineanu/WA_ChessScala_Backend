about.title=About the ChessScala Project
about.intro.text=The ChessScala project is being developed during the Winter Semester 2023/2024 at HTWG Konstanz for the "Web Applications" course.

about.background.title=Project Background
about.background.text=This project builds on the "Software Engineering" course, in which a chess game was created using the Scala programming language. In the "Web Applications" course, the chess game serves as the backend, and the goal of the course is to extend the game using the Play framework to build a web application with a frontend interface.

about.objectives.title=Course Objectives
about.objectives.play.text=Gain experience with the Play framework.
about.objectives.technologies.text=Learn HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Ajax, Vue.js, jQuery, and Web-Sockets.
